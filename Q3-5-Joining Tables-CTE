1. Rockbuster’s management team would like to know the top 10 countries where Rockbuster customers are based :

SELECT 
  D.country, 
  COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

2. write a query to identify the top 10 cities that fall within the top 10 countries you identified in step
WITH  Top10_countries (country) AS (SELECT 
  D.country, 
  COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10)

SELECT 
  D.country, 
  C.city,
  COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
WHERE D.country IN ( SELECT country FROM  Top10_countries
)
GROUP BY D.country, C.city
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

3. write a query to find the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities who’ve paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster
WITH top_cities AS (
  SELECT D.city
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  GROUP BY D.city
  ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
  LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
  A.customer_id,
  SUM(A.amount) AS total_paid,
  B.first_name,
  B.last_name,
  D.city,
  E.country
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN (SELECT city FROM top_cities)
GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5;

4. The payment average of the top 5 paying customers
WITH top5_paying_customers (customer_id) AS (SELECT A.customer_id
  FROM payment A
  GROUP BY A.customer_id
  ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
  LIMIT 5)
SELECT A.customer_id,  B.first_name, B.last_name, AVG(A.amount) AS avg_payment_top5
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
WHERE A.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id  FROM top5_paying_customers 
) 
GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name;

5. Find out how many of the top 5 customers you identified in step 1 are based within each country.
WITH  top5 (customer_id)  AS (SELECT A.customer_id
  FROM payment A
  GROUP BY A.customer_id
  ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
  LIMIT 5)
SELECT 
  E.country,
  COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT top5.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer B
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
LEFT JOIN top5 ON B.customer_id = top5.customer_id
GROUP BY E.country ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC;
